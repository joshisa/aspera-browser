# Introduction

This handbook is designed to serve as a set of standards, styles, and best practices for Watson & Cloud Platform
HTTP APIs. It is expected to grow and evolve over time in order to best address the needs and requirements of users and
developers of Watson & Cloud Platform APIs. To learn how to get involved, see [Contributing](meta/contributing.html).

## Using This Handbook

This handbook is intended to be useful for both education and for reference. In order to be clear about the strength of recommendations, the guidance contained in the handbook uses language from [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14).
However, it is recognized that not every project can fully comply with every directive. And even when certain "SHOULD"
or "MUST" directives cannot be followed for practical reasons, there is value in a project adhering to the remaining
directives in this handbook.
